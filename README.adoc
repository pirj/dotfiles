= Humble dotfiles

Born 2013. Written and cherry-picked with love.

== What's inside

Mostly tmux, vim, git, zsh, urxvt, ruby, js, awesome wm.
Should work in most Linux'es, OSX and BSD. Tested on ArchLinux, OSX 10.11 and OpenBSD.

== Installation

    git clone --recursive --depth 1 --single-branch https://github.com/pirj/dotfiles
    mv dotfiles/.* .
    rm -rf dotfiles
    mkdir .tmp

=== OSX specific

Tell iTunes http://superuser.com/questions/31925/what-can-i-do-to-stop-the-play-pause-button-from-opening-itunes/827710#827710[not to grab the keys]:

    launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rcd.plist

Prevent Chrome from emailing the page when mistyping Command+Option+I with Command+Shift+I:

    defaults write com.google.Chrome NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add 'Email Page Location' '\0'
    defaults write com.google.Chrome.canary NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add 'Email Page Location' '\0'

https://github.com/pirj/noclamshell[No clamshell mode] and https://github.com/pirj/nobacklight[no backlight trick]:

    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pirj/noclamshell/master/noclamshell.plist > ~/Library/LaunchAgents
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pirj/nobacklight/master/nobacklight.plist > ~/Library/LaunchAgents
    launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/nobacklight.plist
    launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/noclamshell.plist

== Inspiration sources

I use to browse repositories on GH, and check other people's dotfiles. dotshare.it is another interesting source.

== Packages

=== On ArchLinux (pacman)

Query (-Q) package list without version numbers (-q), only those explicitly installed (-t) and not required directly by other packages (-tt), native (-n) and foreign (-m):

    pacman -Qqettn >! .packages.native
    pacman -Qqettm >! .packages.foreign

Install:

    sudo pacman -S $(< .packages.native )
    aurget -S $(< .packages.foreign )

=== On OSX (homebrew)

Show installed formulae that are not dependencies of another installed formula:

    brew leaves >! .formulae
    brew cask list >! .casks

Install:

    brew install $(< .formulae )
    brew tap caskroom/cask
    brew cask
    brew cask install $(< .casks)

=== Keeping passwords locally

Create a certificate first:

    gpg --gen-key

To keep GPG encrypted passwords locally:

    echo password | gpg --encrypt --recipient $(whoami) > ~/.passwd/server.gpg

And to get the password back:

    gpg --decrypt --use-agent --quiet --batch --no-tty < ~/.passwd/server.gpg

== TODO

* explain what works:
** vim
** command line, shell
** ruby workflow
* vim plugin bootstrap? pathogen?
* how to install aurget?
* how to install all those aur packages?
* bsd packages?
