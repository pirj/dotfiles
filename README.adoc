= Humble dotfiles

Born 2013. Written and cherry-picked with love.

== What's inside

Mostly tmux, vim, git, zsh, ruby.
Should work in most Linux'es, OSX and BSD. Tested on ArchLinux, OSX 10.14 and OpenBSD.

With Awesome WM on ArchLinux:

== Installation

    git clone --recursive --depth 1 --single-branch https://github.com/pirj/dotfiles .

=== OSX specific

Tell iTunes http://superuser.com/questions/31925/what-can-i-do-to-stop-the-play-pause-button-from-opening-itunes/827710#827710[not to grab the keys]:

    sudo su -
    cd /Applications/iTunes.app/Contents/MacOS
    mv iTunes iTunes.bak
    touch iTunes
    chflags uchg iTunes
    chflags schg iTunes

Prevent Chrome from emailing the page when mistyping Command+Option+I with Command+Shift+I:

    defaults write com.google.Chrome NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add 'Email Page Location' '\0'
    defaults write com.google.Chrome.canary NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add 'Email Page Location' '\0'

https://github.com/pirj/noclamshell[No clamshell mode] (installed via brew) and https://github.com/pirj/nobacklight[no backlight trick]:

    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pirj/nobacklight/master/nobacklight.plist > ~/Library/LaunchAgents
    launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/noclamshell.plist

Add the following to .ssh/config:

    UseKeychain yes

== Inspiration sources

I use to browse repositories on Github, and check other people's dotfiles.
dotshare.it is another interesting source.

== Packages

=== On ArchLinux (pacman)

Query (-Q) package list without version numbers (-q), only those explicitly installed (-t) and not required directly by other packages (-tt), native (-n) and foreign (-m):

    pacman -Qqettn >! .packages.native
    pacman -Qqettm >! .packages.foreign

Install:

    sudo pacman -S $(< .packages.native )
    aurget -S $(< .packages.foreign )

=== On OSX (homebrew)

Show installed formulae that are not dependencies of another installed formula:

    brew leaves >! .formulae
    brew cask list >! .casks

Install:

    brew install $(< .formulae )
    brew tap caskroom/cask
    brew cask
    brew cask install $(< .casks)

== How it works

Vundle that handles Vim plugins and zinit that handles Zsh plugins are fetched as submodules.
Zinit fetches all configured Zsh plugins on first start.
In Vim, `:PluginInstall` installs all plugins.

NeoVim requires a specific Python package to run Python plugins:

    python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade pynvim

For Ruby I'm currently using RVM, but it's not in Homebrew, and it has to be installed by hand. It's tempting to switch to rbenv+ruby-build

I really hope the rest of the configuration is self-explanatory.
